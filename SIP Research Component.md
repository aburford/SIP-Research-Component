Taking School Attendance
=======

# Why do schools take attendance?

The reason for taking attendance is two fold: to keep track of how often students go to class in order to determine if they should receive credit for the class, and keep track of where students are at all times in case of emergency such as a fire or lockdown.

# What is the ideal attendance system?

Each student would have an surgical implant which identifies their exact location at all times in the school building. This would introduce privacy and ethical concerns.

# What is the current attendance system (for Study Hall)?

Students must go up to the front desk to check a box next to their name on a piece of paper. The teacher then manually enters the attendance data into powerschool on their laptop to submit it to powerschool. This is far from ideality, because students can easily check off the names of other students, students must wait in a long line, teachers must take time to enter everything manually, and there is lots of room for human error.

# How can technology offer better solutions?

Students could scan their student ID card. This would be less secure because students could lend their cards to a friend.

Beacons can triangulate all students position throughout the entire school at all times. Less secure because students can lend their phone to a friend.

Our solution is to use beacons that generate a cryptographic hash and use biometric verification for security.

# Why is our solution the best?

Security, privacy, and convenience.
